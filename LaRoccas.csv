review
"Very friendly staff, super clean, easy to get to and locally owned.   We tried three different specialty pizzas that we have never had before and all of them were delicious.    When we get back to Topeka,  LaRocca Pizza will be on top of our list...of places to go and eat."
"LOVE this place for SO many reasons.  They have gone above and beyond in ensuring the safety of our community during the pandemic.  So much respect.  PLUS they offer vegan cheese, so my little one with a dairy allergy is able to eat their pizza....To top it off, their pizza is fantastic!!  They are truly an AWESOME local restaurant!!"
"Have been going to this restaurant for years but since the owner sold the business things started going down hill.  They changed the menu and removed some items.  Went there tonight, the sign said seat yourself so we sat down.  It was about 20 minutes...before we were acknowledged.  The waitress said she thought we was waiting on a to go order.  There was no sign on the table indicating it was a to go table.  Order our meal and we thought things were picking up until our pizza came out. It was the wrong order.  It was already 8:00 and she offer to make another one but then we’d have to wait another 40 minutes.  I won’t be back!!!!"
This pizza is incredible.  Deep dish combo or spicy queso are top notch. Always friendly service.  They carry some local beers too.
I've been in Topeka most of my life and this is the best pizza by far. And the garlic rolls are delicious! I've also had the House Special pasta which is amazing. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. And you can finish...it off with a cannoli!
"Embarrassed to say this was my first visit, definitely won’t be the last. Really good pizza with a perfect crust."
"Good warm pasta, chicken bites, crispy pizza, and cold beer. Plenty to eat and enjoy. Marinara sauce was tasty. Wondered if it was homemade? Popular place that doesn’t taste or feel like a chain pizza parlor. Nice staff and quick service. No reservations needed."
Following our church service our church group goes out for lunch at a local Topeka restaurant. This time we chose LaRocca‘s Pizza. We had reservations and though the restaurant was busy our table was waiting for us. The food was fantastic! I had the 6...inch mini pizza which was delicious. I also had some wonderful breadsticks and dipping sauce. The service was excellent and friendly and the cost was extremely reasonable. I definitely plan to return in the near future.
"This place is legit. Don’t let the outside fool you. The pizza is a thick crust style. The vodka penne pasta was unbelievably taste and full Italian sausage. I’m a big guy and couldn’t finish it. Food came out fast, hot and delicious. I’ll be...back here next year. Very casual place."
We had a group of 30 which they welcomed warmly despite it being a Saturday night. The pizza was great. Very generous toppings. The boneless wings were tasty. Lasagna is not recommended. The LaRocca salad was huge.
"The type of bread and dough at this place is amazing. Just right. Crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. All fresh. Our table had a bit of everything, but was especially impressed with the quality of the sandwiches and the price. Nice...bang for your buck, to say the least."
"It's local, it's quality -- highly recommend. These aren't the thin New York style pizzas. Try the garlic knots!"
"We stopped at the LaRocca,s at Westridge and got the pizza deal with a side and drink for @ 7.00$ the pasta salad side was a meal in itself , no joke I ate the next day for lunch it was chicken pasta killer good...and the Pizza is awesome  !!!"
"I've known the owner Vince for a long time, he puts a lot of love in his food. We like the 2 small pizza special which includes garlic rolls and a 2 liter bottle of pop. Trust me, with 3 locations in Topeka, this is...by far the best pizza.
The Gage location is only open Thursday - Sunday, I believe the Topeka Blvd location is Closed on Monday, but the Mall location is open 7 days a week."
"Friends brought us here and now I believe LaRocca's ""Voted Best Pizza in Kansas"" is no fluke. Just the truth. We got 2 pizza special and get 40% off 2nd pizza.  Brought one home and my mouth is watering!  Friend enjoyed spaghetti and menu has...good variety. Pleasant spacious atmosphere with many ""regulars."" That tells you something. They came back. So will we!"
"First, if you are traveling through Topeka on your travels, LaRocca's is 'Ez off - EZ on' located just 1 block north of the Gage Blvd. exit on the I-470 bypass.

I arranged for our casual dinner club to meet here last weekend and almost..."
"The service isn't the best (very slow, inexperienced staff) but the pizza and spaghetti are fantastic!  Love the garlic rolls, but wish they would provide more while we are waiting to be served."
"We went here for dinner and ordered the Garlic Knots as an appetizer - they were delicious and served with a TON of butter sauce on them. 
I had the La Roccas salad which was huge and tasty.
We had a pizza for the table..."
"Fresh ingredients, friendly staff, very reasonable prices, what more can I say? Well...the food is really good!! You gotta try the small pizza special which includes 2 small pizzas that are NOT small, garlic rolls, and a 2 liter bottle of cola for under $20...."
"I can't say enough good about LaRocca's.  The servers and owner are wonderful, but the food....it is simply the best pizza I've ever eaten!  What else can I tell you -"
Voted best in Kansas 150. They have great daily deals on pizza. Dine in or take out. It was 5 minutes from our KOA. They mixed up our pizza but they made it right and gave us another pizza no charge. Try their garlic rolls!!!!
When visiting Topeka for business LaRocca's is my go to place for lunch or dinner. The Italian salad is a meal in itself. The garlic bread rolls are wonderful. On a recent trip I ordered both for takeout along with the pasta special - a...

"Very good pizza. Best crust in Topeka. Excellant service. Gokd variety on menu. Decor at Gage store is pretty bland, which is the only reason i didnt give it a 5 rating."
"We love LaRoccas!!
Great, Great Pizza!Great service, Great prices and VERY CLEAN!! NEVER A BAD EXPERIENCE.

We typical get their large pizza special. A large 3 topping pizza, 4 homemade garlic rolls and 2 drinks for $17.99

Highly recommend eating here!!!"

"This place is just  off  of the interstate at 29th and 470. Nice clean place,  great customer  service and the owner is there all the time.  The pizza is a thinner crust with great sauce.  Make sure you have the garlic bread balls with  marinara..."
Their pizza & desserts were awesome but unfortunately the location on Urish closed awhile back. I think that they may still have a location in Topeka that's just off 29th & Gage.
We ordered garlic rolls and a small one-topping pizza. The pizza was nice and thick with a good crust and lots of cheese. It reminded me a bit of a better version of Pizza Hut (less greasy). We ordered the garlic rolls based on reviews...

"A small place, but very yummy food.  Take a break from the chain restaurants and eat at a local place; you won't regret it."
Thank you for your great review! We love serving our customers and hearing how we are doing. You should check out our new location on SW Gage! It's larger and we have a party room now too. We look forward to serving you again!
Pizza is very good and tastes authentic.  Staff is friendly and service is fairly fast.  I would recommend over any chains in Topeka.  You won't regret it!
Simple selection of ingredients.  Like the thin crispy crust.  Very tasty garlic rolls.  Not much for atmosphere.  Tight seating quarters. Soft drinks only.  I like beer with my pizza.
This place is great.  They have Garlic Rolls that just melt in your mouth.  The crust on the pizza is delicious and the sauce is just right.  I keep meaning to have a sandwich when I go but the pizza keeps drawing me back in....
"We ordered several large pizzas from LaRocca's to feed our employees as we were preparing for our annual conference. The pizza was really good, the slices were very generous. Most people only ate one slice and topped it with one of LaRocca's yummy garlic rolls...."
