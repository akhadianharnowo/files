April 2023,"April 18, 2023 ",5,Good food and good value,"My husband and I went into the restaurant at 11:10 AM on a Tuesday and were the first customers.  Within 15 minutes, the front room of the place was nearly full.  We ordered from the lunch menu, a sweet chili salad for my husband and pad thai for me.  Our order was taken promptly.  We were served small cups of egg drop soup while waiting for our entrees, which arrived fairly promptly.  Both meals were very tasty and also filling.  The prices were very reasonable.  If we lived in Topeka, we would eat here often."
February 2023,"February 18, 2023 ",5,Yummy Thai,"Soya bean noodles with chicken, phad Thai and massaman curry are some of my favorites. Lunch comes with soup and egg roll. Moneybags are great appetizers."
July 2022,"July 19, 2022 ",5,Excellent Thai,"Incredible food at reasonable prices. We eat here everyone we are in Topeka. It is not much to look at from the outside, but inside is very nice. Staff are friendly and attentive. Egg drop soup is the best I have tried."
January 2022,"January 2, 2022 ",3,"Fair Asian food, not authentic Thai","Went there on the new year day on the route to come home. Not busy at all and lots of waiters working. Service was excellent, fast and friendly. Food is not authentic Thai at all. Green curry was way too sweet. Pad Thai also way too sweet, not spicy which I asked for medium ( I‚Äôm Thai). The best plate might be lucky noodles which my son and my husband enjoyed but that was somewhat Chinese, not Thai. We ordered sticky rice and mango for dessert, sticky rice was too mushy for me but my kids like it ( they didn‚Äôt grow up in Thailand)."
October 2021,"November 28, 2021 ",5,delicious Thai in Topeka,"Who would have thought that there would be such delicious Thai in this mid west city.  Food is authentic and service was great (Haley).  We had the lemongrass soup, roasted duck dish, lucky noodles with veggies.  

We are New Yorkers who travel a lot and have been to Thailand.  

We really enjoyed our meal."

July 2021,"July 1, 2021 ",5,Great find!,"We were driving across the country and stayed in Topeka.   Saw this Thai restaurant on TripAdvisor and it had good reviews, so we gave it a shot. Great flavor in the green curry, big pieces of eggplant nicely cooked chicken. The sticky rice and mango was also good. The drunken noodles were good, and added Thai hot spices, just as we asked.  They even brought me the food to my car!"
March 2021,"March 23, 2021 ",4,We keep coming back.,"Since we discovered this place last summer, we‚Äôve been coming back about once a month to try different menu items. We like the freshness of the ingredients and flavor profiles on most of the dishes. Flavor consistency is somewhat of a challenge still. Overall, the flavors are pretty decent and the food is always good. Service is always great here. My new favorite dish is the turmeric fried rice. It has more of the savory curry notes than turmeric and I am good with that because too much turmeric can make the dish a little bitter."
November 2020,"November 13, 2020 ",5,Delicious! Best coconut soup!,Delicious! Best coconut soup I‚Äôve ever tasted! Drunken noodles and Pad Thai were excellent as well. Highly recommended.
August 2020,"September 27, 2020 ",5,Best pad Thai!!,"Excellent food, great service, and atmosphere. Best pad Thai in town, hands down! Perfect for date night and family get togethers"
June 2020,"June 21, 2020 ",4,A little salty but very tasty,"Was in search of something flavorful in Topeka and was so glad that this place was open as the online reviews brought us here. We were promptly sat in a socially distanced table , the waitress was attentive, pleasant and very helpful with making spice/heat level recommendations when we informed her that it was our first visit and what spice levels we were used to at other Thai restaurants. We ordered the Tuptim wings, the pad see eaw and the assorted vegetable entree. The chicken wings were finger licking tasty. The vegetable entree was very subtle and tasty.  The heat on the pad see eaw was perfect. The dish was very flavorful but a little on the salty side for me. The waitress was attentive but not overly so we never really needed to ask for topups. Will be back to try the lunch specials soon."
December 2019,"February 11, 2020 ",4,Didn‚Äôt do well with small child,I have been here many times usually as a casual lunch with family. I went this time with a group from my mom‚Äôs office. It was a Christmas dinner with everyone‚Äôs family. The staff was a little rude when my 2 year old was being a 2 year old. There was no children‚Äôs menu. I don‚Äôt recommend taking small children or ordering the crab fried rice it was not up to the normal quality of the other food.
December 2019,"December 22, 2019 ",5,Far and away the best Asian in Topeka ,"Far and away the best Asian food in Topeka! Tuptim is probably some of the best Thai food I‚Äôve had outside Seattle or L.A. And it‚Äôs one of the 2 or 3 best restaurants in Topeka, period. I haven‚Äôt tried their other Asian dishes, because their Thai food is so good! I keep coming back to Tuptim because it‚Äôs consistently great food and excellent service."
December 2019,"December 16, 2019 ",5,"Great food consistently, and now SUSHI","We love going to Tuptim. They raised their prices a little but they're still a bargain with most entrees between $10 and $18 or so. I love their Tom Yum soup and got it again this Friday night. My wife got their gluten free Pad Thai and loved it. Always great service too. And I have to say that their garnish of slivered carrots and Daikon radishes is brilliant and irresistibly tasty.

But sushi. Not a huge menu but still plenty to choose from. They customized a California roll for the lady and made me Philly roll with yummy smoked salmon on top. 

Definitely going back soon."
September 2019,"November 4, 2019 ",5,Great food!,I always get the Pad Thai because I love it so much. My husband will try other dishes. They are always a little too spicey for me.
